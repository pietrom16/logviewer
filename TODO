TODO - logviewer

. Bug: command line parameters wrongly read after -d ; tag/value.
	. Not a bug: in this case, use double quotes around the delimiters.

-- Text highlighting tests:
	. Bug: when multiple tags are in the same sentence, pick the one with highest value.
	. Option: for log files, just pick the first level value.
	. Consider ignoring \n as a delimiter, since many files are done with single lines.
		. logviewer.cpp:876
	- More testing.

-- Show multiple log files.

- Change pause functionality: stop loading new logs, but keep interacting.

. ProgArgs: Check if multiple parameters with the same tag can coexist. OK.
	-- Allow to pass multiple values for each command line parameter (especially inclusion/exclusion tokens).

- Add logviewer aliases with default parameters for specific uses.

- Better randomize the colors in LogLevelMapping().

- LogFormatter: HTML and markdown formatting.

-- rdKb: destroied, but never recreated.


BUGS

- [Windows]: when the log grows, the new logs are not printed automatically (ENTER must be pressed).
- Check if it is normal that destructors are not called before exit.
- Check timing in text view.
