TODO - logviewer

. Create a test directory, with all the files related to tests.

-- Consider using: 	bool show; cout << (show?"...":"") << endl;

--- Allow to specify multiple sentence separators, e.g. ".;\n", or use '\n' as a default separator.
	--- Text block: delimited by either a specific character (e.g. '.'), or by a new line.
	--- std::basic_string::find_first_of(const std::basic_string& str, size_type pos = 0) const;

-- LogFormatter: HTML and markdown formatting.

-- Option to print log/sentence/line number. Done; further testing needed.
	. Pre-context logs: pick their number when storing them in the container.

- Group code blocks in separate functions/classes.

. ProgArgs: Check if multiple parameters with the same tag can coexist. OK.
	-- Allow to pass multiple values for each command line parameter (especially inclusion/exclusion tokens).

- Add logviewer aliases with default parameters for specific uses.

- Allow navigation/collapse/expansion in an interactive way.

-- Change pause functionality: stop loading new logs, but keep interacting.

- Better randomize the colors in LogLevelMapping().

- When printing the list of log levels, the latest one is printed twice.


BUGS

- [Windows]: when the log grows, the new logs are not printed automatically (ENTER must be pressed).
