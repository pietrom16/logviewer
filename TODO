TODO - logviewer

. Allow to control the logviewer while running through a "command file".
	. Correctly loads and executes the commands.
	. The cmd file is deleted.
	. BUG: console stops showing keyboard inputs.


. Allow to specify multiple sentence separators, e.g. ".;\n", or use '\n' as a default separator.
	- Text block: delimited by either a specific character (e.g. '.'), or by a new line.
	- When using the '.' separator, consider that it could be a decimal point and not a full stop.

-- Show multiple log files.

-- LogFormatter: HTML and markdown formatting.

-- Change pause functionality: stop loading new logs, but keep interacting.

. ProgArgs: Check if multiple parameters with the same tag can coexist. OK.
	-- Allow to pass multiple values for each command line parameter (especially inclusion/exclusion tokens).

- Consider using: 	bool show; cout << (show?"...":"") << endl;

- Add logviewer aliases with default parameters for specific uses.

- Allow navigation/collapse/expansion in an interactive way.

- Better randomize the colors in LogLevelMapping().

-- rdKb: destroied, but never recreated.


BUGS

- [Windows]: when the log grows, the new logs are not printed automatically (ENTER must be pressed).
- Check if it is normal that destructors are not called before exit.
